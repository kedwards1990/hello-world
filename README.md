# hello-world
Hello! Keith here. I really don't have too much to say besides I'm taking a leap of faith a big leap of faith in all of this. I will also do whatever it takes to succeed in whatever direction I may decide to go within the industry.
I have recently left the service industry to become a certified welder. I am still trying to find my niche within the field but it doesn't seem like anything is coming up.
